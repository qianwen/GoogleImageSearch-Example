GoogleImageSearch-Example
=========================

This example demostrates how to use `UICollectionView` and create a grid-like layout easily. It uses the the default grid-based layout (i.e. UICollectionViewFlowLayout).
All the images are fetched from Google Image Search API. (It is deprecated. I will update to use the custom search api in the future)
